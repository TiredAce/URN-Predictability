# Network Predictability and Road Network Classification

This part is the implementation of road network classification and predictability analysis. We aggregate 11 measures to extract the topology features from a road network. These measures consist of the node degree distribution, road circuity and dendricity. Based on these measures, we study the relation between

* Network predictability vs. network type
* Network predictability vs. principle component of aggregated measures

## Requirements
* python 3.6
* networkx 2.1
